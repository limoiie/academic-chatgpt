```

## Development

```bash
cargo tauri dev
```

## Production

cargo tauri build
```

## Usage

Academic-chatgpt needs [openai api](https://platform.openai.com/overview) to embedding documents and [pinecone api](https://www.pinecone.io/) for storing, indexing and searching the documents by the embeddings.
So, please follow the following instructions to create accounts for both openai api and pinecone, and get necessary informations.

- create your openai api key at [here](https://platform.openai.com/account/api-keys);
- create your pinecone api key and index at [here](https://app.pinecone.io/);
  - **NOTE**: when dimension of the index should be 1536, as it is embedding size of openai embeddings;
  - retrieve the environment bound with api key and index name from the console.

You will be asked for providing these keys when you first run the application.
